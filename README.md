# RobotyagaGame
Course project on the discipline "programming". The project is made in 2020, using the programming language C++ and SDL 2 library.
The project is a platformer game in which the player must complete a level. The main character of the game is a robot named Robotyaga. While passing the level Robotyaga gets several types of weapons (bombs, boomerang, etc.), picks up keys to pass through doors of corresponding colors. There are also several types of enemies in the game:
- regular enemy (chases the player, deals damage on contact)
- exploding enemy (starts exploding if the player is nearby)
- mental enemy (deals damage if it is on the player's screen)
